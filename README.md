# ScammerJammer
ScammerJammer is a web-app designed to allow users to search up and report suspicious numbers that may be from scam callers.

Unfortunately, due to the miracles and mysteries of github when pushing code, a large chunk of the source code was wiped from existence just after our deployment to Firebase. You can find that deployment here: https://protoscammerjammer2.web.app/

What source code that could be recovered is located within the main branch.
